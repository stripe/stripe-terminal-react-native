# Example Application

Before starting your own integration, we recommend setting up one of the Terminal example applications. This will give you a better feel for how the components of a Terminal integration fit together and show you the interactions between the SDK, the reader, your point of sale application, and your backend code.

You can find full instructions on setting this application up along with a sample backend at https://stripe.com/docs/terminal/example-applications
