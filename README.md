# Stripe Terminal React Native SDK

Stripe Terminal enables you to build your own in-person checkout to accept payments in the physical world. Built on Stripe's payments network, Terminal helps you unify your online and offline payment channels. With the Stripe Terminal React Native SDK, you can connect to pre-certified card readers from your React Native app and drive a customized in-store checkout flow.

# Getting started

> Note: The below docs are not yet available and will be released as we near open beta

Get started with our [ðŸ“š integration guides](https://stripe.com/docs/terminal/payments/setup-sdk?terminal-sdk-platform=react-native) and [example project](#run-the-example-app), or [ðŸ“˜ browse the SDK reference](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-react-native).

Updating to a newer version of the SDK? See our [changelog](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-react-native/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

# Requirements

## JS

- The SDK uses TypeScript features available in Babel version `7.9.0` and above.
  Alternatively use the `plugin-transform-typescript` plugin in your project.

## Android

- Android 5.0 (API level 21) and above
- compileSdkVersion = 31
- targetSdkVersion = 31

## iOS

- Compatible with apps targeting iOS 10 or above.

# Installation

```sh
yarn add @stripe/stripe-terminal-react-native
or
npm install @stripe/stripe-terminal-react-native
```

> Note: early access beta users will need to install from git with

```
yarn add https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-react-native
or
npm install https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-react-native
```

# Setup

## React Native CLI

### iOS

You'll need to run `pod install` in your `ios` directory to install the native dependencies.

#### Permissions

Location services must be enabled in order to use the SDK on iOS. Add the following key-value pair to your app's `Info.plist` file:

- Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description

Update:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string></string>
```

to

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Location access is required in order to accept payments.</string>
```

> Note: Stripe needs to know where payments occur to reduce risks associated with those charges and to minimize disputes. If the SDK canâ€™t determine the iOS deviceâ€™s location, payments are disabled until location access is restored.

For your app to run in the background and remain connected to the reader, add this key-value pair to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>bluetooth-central</string>
</array>
```

For your app to pass validation when submitting to the App Store, add the following key-value pairs as well:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>Bluetooth access is required in order to connect to supported bluetooth card readers.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses Bluetooth to connect to supported card readers.</string>
```

### Android

#### Permissions

In order for the Stripe Terminal SDK to function properly we'll need to enable the following permissions:

- `PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`
- `PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.BLUETOOTH_SCAN`
- `PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`

> Note: Stripe needs to know where payments occur to reduce risks associated with those charges and to minimize disputes. If the SDK canâ€™t determine the iOS deviceâ€™s location, payments are disabled until location access is restored.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  async function init() {
    try {
      const granted = await PermissionsAndroid.request(
        PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION,
        {
          title: 'Location Permission',
          message: 'Stripe Terminal needs access to your location',
          buttonPositive: 'Accept',
        }
      );
      if (granted === PermissionsAndroid.RESULTS.GRANTED) {
        console.log('You can use the Location');
      } else {
        console.error(
          'Location services are required in order to connect to a reader.'
        );
      }
    } catch {}
  }
  init();
}, []);
```

For convenience, Stripe Terminal SDK also provides an util that handles all needed Android permissions.
In order to use it follow below instrustions:

```tsx
import { requestNeededAndroidPermissions } from 'stripe-terminal-react-native';

try {
  const granted = await requestNeededAndroidPermissions({
    accessFineLocation: {
      title: 'Location Permission',
      message: 'Stripe Terminal needs access to your location',
      buttonPositive: 'Accept',
    },
  });
  if (granted) {
    // init SDK
  } else {
    console.error(
      'Location and BT services are required in order to connect to a reader.'
    );
  }
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
}
```

#### Manifest

To enable compatibility the library with the latest Android 12 please make sure that you add following requirements:

Add `android:exported="true"` to the `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest ...>
    <application android:name=".MainApplication">
      <activity
        android:name=".MainActivity"
        android:exported="true">
          <!-- content -->
      </activity>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Please read the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#exported) to establish the exact value that you need to set.

## Usage With Expo

> Note: This package cannot be used in the "Expo Go" app because [it requires custom native code](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/customizing/).

### Android

#### build.gradle

For android you'll need to massage your build files in order to properly compile. First in `android/build.gradle` by updating both `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` to at least `31`:

```
buildscript {
    ext {
        buildToolsVersion = "29.0.3"
        minSdkVersion = 21
        compileSdkVersion = 31
        targetSdkVersion = 31
    }
```

Next ensure that jetifier is ignoring the `moshi` lib by adding the following to `android/gradle.properties`:

```
android.jetifier.ignorelist=moshi-1.13.0.jar
```

or

```
android.jetifier.blacklist=moshi-1.13.0.jar
```

Depending on the version of jetifier in use.

#### Permissions

Android will still require runtime permissions checks for location and BT access, we've provided an expo specific util to run these checks as follows:

```
import { requestNeededExpoAndroidPermissions } from 'stripe-terminal-react-native';

try {
  const granted = await requestNeededExpoAndroidPermissions({
    accessFineLocation: {
      title: 'Location Permission',
      message: 'Stripe Terminal needs access to your location',
      buttonPositive: 'Accept',
    },
  });
  if (granted) {
    // init SDK
  } else {
    console.error(
      'Location and BT services are required in order to connect to a reader.'
    );
  }
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
}
```

### iOS

No special steps are required for iOS!

### Configuring the SDK

After [installing](#installation) the SDK, add the [config plugin](https://docs.expo.io/guides/config-plugins/) to the [`plugins`](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/config/app/#plugins) array of your `app.json` or `app.config.js`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "stripe-terminal-react-native",
        {
          "bluetoothBackgroundMode": true,
          "locationWhenInUsePermission": "Location access is required in order to accept payments.",
          "bluetoothPeripheralPermission": "Bluetooth access is required in order to connect to supported bluetooth card readers.",
          "bluetoothAlwaysUsagePermission": "This app uses Bluetooth to connect to supported card readers."
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Build

Rebuild your app as described in the ['Adding custom native code'](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/customizing/) guide with:

```
> expo prebuild

and then

> expo run:ios
or
> expo run:android
```

# Example Code

## Initialization

To initialize Stripe Terminal SDK in your React Native app, use the `StripeTerminalProvider` component in the root component of your application.

First, create an endpoint on your backend server that creates a new connection token via the Stripe Terminal API.

Next, create a token provider that will fetch connection token from your server and provide it to StripeTerminalProvider as a parameter.
Stripe Terminal SDK will fetch it when it's needed.

```tsx
// Root.ts
import { StripeTerminalProvider } from '@stripe/stripe-terminal-react-native';

function Root() {
  const fetchTokenProvider = async () => {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/connection_token`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
    });
    const { secret } = await response.json();
    return secret;
  };

  return (
    <StripeTerminalProvider
      logLevel="verbose"
      tokenProvider={fetchTokenProvider}
    >
      <App />
    </StripeTerminalProvider>
  );
}
```

As a last step, simply call `initialize` method from `useStripeTerminal` hook.
Please note that `initialize` method must be called from a nested component of `StripeTerminalProvider`.

```tsx
// App.tsx
function App() {
  const { initialize } = useStripeTerminal();

  useEffect(() => {
    initialize({
      logLevel: 'verbose',
    });
  }, [initialize]);

  return <View />;
}
```

## Hooks and Events

Stripe Terminal SDK provides dedicated hook which exposes bunch of methods and props to be used within your App.
Additionally, you have access to the internal state of SDK that contains information about the current connection, discovered readers and loading state.

```tsx
// Screen.ts

import { useStripeTerminal } from '@stripe/stripe-terminal-react-native';

import {
  useStripeTerminal,
} from '@stripe/stripe-terminal-react-native';

export default function PaymentScreen() {
  const { discoverReaders, connectedReader, discoveredReaders } =
    useStripeTerminal({
      onUpdateDiscoveredReaders: (readers) => {
        // access to discovered readers
      },
      onDidChangeConnectionStatus: (status) => {
        // access to the current connection status
      },
    });

  useEffect(() => {
    const { error } = await discoverReaders({
      discoveryMethod: 'bluetoothScan',
      simulated: true,
    });
  }, [discoverReaders]);

  return <View />;
}
```

In case your app uses `React Class Components` you can use dedicated `withStripeTerminal` Higher-Order-Component.
Please note that unlike the hooks approach, you need to use event emitter to listen on specific events that comes from SDK.

[Here](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-react-native/blob/main/src/hooks/useStripeTerminal.tsx#L51) you can find the list of available events to be used within the event emitter.

Example:

```tsx
import {
  withStripeTerminal,
  WithStripeTerminalProps,
  CHANGE_CONNECTION_STATUS,
  Reader,
  componentDidMount() {
    this.discoverReaders();

    const eventSubscription = props.emitter.addListener(
      CHANGE_CONNECTION_STATUS, // didChangeConnectionStatus
      (status: Reader.ConnectionStatus) => {
        // access to the current connection status
      }
    );
  }

  async discoverReaders() {
    this.props.discoverReaders({
      discoveryMethod: 'bluetoothScan',
      simulated,
    });
  }
}

export default withStripeTerminal(PaymentScreen);
```
